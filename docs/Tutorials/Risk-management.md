**ROAM** is a technique to manage risks in SAFe. It is primarily used during PI planning where risks for the whole train (program) are managed. This is usually done the last day of PI planning. While doing the planning, the teams will most likely identify several risks and impediments that can impact their ability to meet their PI objectives. These risks are documented by the team and then managed in front of the whole train at a risk session.

At this risk session the risks are discussed one by one openly so that everybody can help in finding a way to handle them. They are then categorized into one of four categories:
* **R**esolved – The teams agree that the risk is no longer a concern. 
* **O**wned – Someone on the train takes ownership of the risk since it cannot be resolved during PI planning. 
* **A**ccepted – Some risks are just facts or potential problems that must be understood and accepted. 
* **M**itigated – Teams identify a plan to reduce the impact of the risk.

Many ARTs use a whiteboard in the front of the room where a ROAM grid has been prepared. When using @Scale the ROAM board typically is setup with an initial program risk column and then the ROAM columns, matching states on a Risk work item.

The risks are read out aloud and an open discussion about them is had. After the risk is discussed, a card with the risk is placed on the board at the category the team(s) selected. 

After the session most programs document the risks in their work item tracking system (like Azure DevOps Boards) so everybody can access them without going to the actual physical board.

Some primary benefits of this way of managing risk is that transparency and collaboration are greatly increased. Everybody can see the risks and collaborate on the resolution or mitigation of them.

During PI planning the team members document any risk(s) they encounter and writes them down on a digital post-it in Conceptboard. All risks are first documented on the left side of the board where they stay until the ROAM session.

When it is time for the ROAMing session everybody meets in Microsoft Teams and the RTE facilitates the meeting. Since everybody can see the risk board live everybody are updated continuously.

The RTE starts by selecting a risk from the left of the board and the person who wrote it explains what it is about. The whole team then collaborate to see if they have a solution already now or how else to handle it. They then place the risk in either R, O, A or M on the board and continues this way with all risks. Any duplicate risks are collected under one single risk.

It is the RTE in this case that updates the backlog with the risks after the session. The risks are then worked on during coming sprints and are followed up during the next PI session.
