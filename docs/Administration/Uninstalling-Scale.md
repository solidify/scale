If you no longer have use for @Scale it's a simple process to uninstall the extension. Since we don't store any of your data outside of Azure DevOps and we don't want to interfere with your content we decided to make uninstall a manual process. 

To uninstall @Scale from your organization you need to:

* **Cancel your subscription**. Reach out to us at [scale@solidify.dev](mailto://scale@solidify.dev) and we'll help you.
* **Revert the process customization**. We add additional work item types to your process. If you no longer wish to use those they can be removed manually.
* **Remove extension data**. We store settings for the extension in Azure DevOps extension [data storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/develop/data-storage). This will not be available after the extension has been uninstalled.
* **Uninstall extension**. As an organization administrator you can remove the @Scale extension following the steps to [Uninstall or disable extensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/marketplace/uninstall-disable-extensions).
