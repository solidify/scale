Unlike if you are using Azure DevOps Service (cloud), running Azure DevOps Services on-premise currently requires us to do some manual configuration. Should the APIs to automate the way we configure @Scale in the service also come to Azure DevOps Server we will of course leverage that option.

That said, of course we'll make @Scale work for you so if you are using Azure DevOps service contact us at [scale@solidify.dev](mailto://scale@solidify.dev) and we'll work with you to get @Scale installed and configured in your environment!
