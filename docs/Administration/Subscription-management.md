When Scale is installed for the first time it is required to acquire a subscription matching the use of the extension. A subscription can be created directly from the extension or created by us for scenarios such as pay by invoice or support for Azure DevOps Server (on-premise).

# Create subscription
When Scale is loaded it checks for a valid subscription. If no subscription is found the user is asked to create one.

When you enter @Scale for the first time you can create a trial subscription by two ways:
* Heading into Azure DevOps > Boards > @Scale.  Select a plan and choose to start a **free trial**,
* Heading into Azure DevOps Organization/collection settings and you'll find @Scale in the bottom of the list to the left.

# Trial

You should be able to try @Scale before you buy, therefore we offer a 30-day free trial per Azure DevOps organization.

## How can I change from trial to a paid plan?

If you want to activate a production subscription you only need to go to the organization admin page, select @Scale and from the Subscription page select Subscribe. Fill out the details as described in [Paid subscription](#paid-subscription).

If you want to change plan or discuss an Enterprise subscription, contact us at [scale@solidify.dev](mailto://scale@solidify.dev).

## What happens after the trial?

When the trial expires you will no longer be able to access @Scale. Since we don't want to interfere with your data we will not remove anything when the subscription ends. Therefore to remove the data @Scale has added to your Azure DevOps environment you need to follow the instruction in [Uninstalling @Scale](/docs/Administration/Uninstalling-Scale.md).

# Subscription overview

The subscription overview shows information about the subscription.
