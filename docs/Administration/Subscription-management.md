When Scale is installed for the first time it is required to acquire a subscription matching the use of the extension. A subscription can be created directly from the extension or created by us for scenarios such as pay by invoice or support for Azure DevOps Server (on-premise).

# Create subscription
When Scale is loaded it checks for a valid subscription. If no subscription is found the user is asked to create one.

When you enter @Scale for the first time you can create a trial subscription by two ways:
* Heading into Azure DevOps > Boards > @Scale.  Select a plan and choose to start a **free trial**,
* Heading into Azure DevOps Organization/collection settings and you'll find @Scale in the bottom of the list to the left.

## Paid subscription using Azure Subscription

You can easily pay for @Scale using an Azure subscription. Many time there is already a process for paying for 3rd-party Azure DevOps extensions already in your organization and then the cost for @Scale can be managed the same way.

For more information see [Azure Marketplace purchasing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/azure-purchasing-invoicing).

Here's the process to purchase @Scale from the Azure Marketplace:

1. Prepare an Azure subscription to use for purchasing @scale.
2. Go to [@Scale at Microsoft Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/solidify.scale-planning).
3. Click on "Get it now" and sign in to Azure using an account connected to the Azure subscription you plan to use.
4. Select the plan you want from the list (you may also have been shared a private offering if you have discussed an Enterprise agreement with us) and click Subscribe.

## Paid subscription using Credit card

If you would like to pay for a subscription using credit card you can find the subscription details in Azure DevOps Organization/collection settings. Once you press on **Subscribe** you will get prompted to fill in a credit card to pay for the subscription.

## Paid subscription using invoice

If you want to purchase @Scale and pay by invoice then contact us at [scale@solidify.dev](mailto://scale@solidify.dev).

# Trial

You should be able to try @Scale before you buy, therefore we offer a 30-day free trial per Azure DevOps organization. 

<img width="649" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83336871/202516361-5638aa20-8b91-4f9e-8232-f7bfd5a9b042.png">


## How can I change from trial to a paid plan?

If you want to activate a production subscription you only need to go to the organization admin page, select @Scale and from the Subscription page select Subscribe. Fill out the details as described in [Paid subscription](#paid-subscription).

If you want to change plan or discuss an Enterprise subscription, contact us at [scale@solidify.dev](mailto://scale@solidify.dev).

## What happens after the trial?

When the trial expires you will no longer be able to access @Scale. Since we don't want to interfere with your data we will not remove anything when the subscription ends. Therefore to remove the data @Scale has added to your Azure DevOps environment you need to follow the instruction in [Uninstalling @Scale](/docs/Administration/Uninstalling-Scale.md).
