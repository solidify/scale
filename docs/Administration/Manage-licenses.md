The @Scale extension is a licensed product and not sold. The license format is a subscription license where the Licensee can add and remove users based on needs. When a user gets added into the license pool a deduction will be made from the available number of licenses in the subscription.

@Scale licenses are separate from Azure DevOps licenses, where the purpose of the @Scale license is to control who gets access to the extension and in what role. See [Permissions]() for details on how the model works.

# Request license

When Scale is loaded and has a valid subscription it checks if the user has a license. If the user does not have a license a screen is presented where the user can request a license. The request is then approved and a role assigned by the subscription owner or an Azure DevOps administrator.
