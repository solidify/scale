To configure the extension you need process configuration permissions in the Azure DevOps organization/collection or admin permission to create or manage an inherited process for the project.

After the extension has been installed you access @Scale from the Boards Menu in Azure DevOps.

# Customization
If you'd like some guidance for more customization on the process template, feel free to reach out to us at support.scale@solidify.dev

Chaning the @Scale process through our user interface:

Example:

If you already have an Objective work item type in your Azure DevOps process template and would like to use that one instead of creating a new one with Scale.
You can now edit in the config through the UI to use this work item type instead of being forced to use our custom work item type.
