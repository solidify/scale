The program increment selector is a per user setting used to specify the current program increment. The active PI is used in all views that are context aware so if you set the PI in one view it will apply to all other as well.

The PI selector is build to make it easy for you to switch between PIs to check out previous increments or look at how the different ARTs are doing.
