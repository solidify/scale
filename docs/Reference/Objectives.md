# Managing Objectives

The Objectives hub is intended to give overview of the goals set for the teams a Workspace level as well as per team. You add new objectives from the "+ New objective" button (6), which adds a new row to the table. In the table you can click on the title to open the work item form for the Objective (1). If the feature is associated with a board item you can expand the row to show the linked items (2) with title and state. The committed column (3) shows if an objective is committed or uncommitted. 

Next the planned and actual business values are shown and also rolled up to a total % (4) based on the values for all committed items. For the associated board item the current state of each is shown as well as a roll up to indicate completeness (5).

Linking and unlinking board items is done from the action commands on each row (7). Linking board items is not a required practice but can be used to give additional insights into the state of delivery and likeliness to reach on objective.  

When loaded, the Workspace and Team nodes are collapsed to give you a better overview. Click the expander link (8) to show the objectives and linked board items.

## New objective

To add a new objective you only need to give it a title. Then later you can edit the objective to set if it is a committed or uncommitted objective. You can also set the planned business value and, at a later point, the actual business value for the delivered feature.
