## Setting up WSJF
When you first enter WSJF you should set up your custom fields to be worked at.
If you're missing a specific field you can add it to the specific work item type.

Then you can choose the fields in the setup:

Clicking on a specific field lets you choose what field you'd like to put the data in.

In the board settings you can change what values to work with or asign custom numerical values

## 6x6 grid (effort/value) (Essentials of WSJF)
We see this view as a "light" version of our WSJF-estimation and as a good starting point if you haven't worked with WSJF before.
What gives the most value with the least amount of effort?
As you drag the cards they get their designated values into the fields of the work item and count the WSJF score.

1. WSJF Tab - Click here to enter our WSJF & load your first query
2. Query filter - Choose filters & run a query the feature & epics you've chosen to be looked at
3. Run query - Click here to run & load your query
4. Layout picker - Choose which values you would like to work with (in this case we've chosen 6x6 (effort & value)
5. WSJF Settings - Choose settings like allowing fields, using different values (Fibonacci, even, odd numbers or custom)
6. Column for work item types without values to be put in the matrix
7. Visual estimation - As you drag the cards into these fields they get a designated value assigned to the work item
8. The result column - the work items with the highest WSJF-score gets put at the top

## 1x6 grid (Risk reduction, Time criticality, Effort & Value)
We added 1x6 grids to work with the values of WSJF.
As you place features on the board they get their assigned value added to the card.
