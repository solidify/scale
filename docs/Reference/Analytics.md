The Analytics hub gives you insights into how your teams perform. The reports in @Scale complements the built-in reports for metrics like the cumulative flow diagram.

# Solution Train Predictability 
This report shows how the ART delivers on the objectives compared to what was planned. Only committed objectives are included in the diagram. The diagram shows the percentage of actual business value compared to estimated business value for each ART and program increment. The average for all ARTs is also shown as a metric for the predictability of the group.

# Program Predictability
The Program Predictability report works in the same way as the Solution Train Predictability report but instead of ARTs the performance of each Team in the selected ART is shown.
