Keeping track of project risks is key to successfully deliver on target. Use the risk board in @Scale to ROAM risk during PI planning and as a board to manage the risks over the course of delivering the next increment of your product.

# Managing risks

When you have identify a risk you can quickly add it to the board using the "+ new item" button (1). New risks are added the the first column (2) and then moved to the different board columns as the risks are discussed and triaged. The cards can be customized from the settings dialog if you want to show additional fields.

## Fields settings

The fields settings for the risk board works in the same way as other board settings where the card appearance can be changed. The settings in this case is stored specifically for the Risk work item type.

The settings dialog lets you configure

1. **Core fields**. These are the essential fields you typically want to show on the card.
2. **Additional fields**. Add up to 10 custom fields to show on the board. The Parent field has the extra feature of showing the field with a link that opens the work item form.
3. **Show empty fields**. Enable if you want to show the field even if it does not have a value.
